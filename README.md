# Weather Dashboard Application

## Description

- My motivation behind this project was to create an interactive Note Taker that could organize and saves peoples notes regarding tasks they want to complete throughout the day.
- I built this project to help people plan out their their day by saving their notes and organizing them in a central place where they can delete what they have already accomplished. 
- This allows for a place to digitally keep their plans to easily access and help organization and motivation. 
- I learned how to use node and express to save and retrieve data from a JSON file.
